= SELECT

== Synopsis

[source,sql]
----
SELECT [ * | expression [ [ AS ] expression_alias ] [, ...] ]
FROM table_name [ [ AS ] table_alias ]
[WHERE condition]
----

== Description

The `SELECT` command retrieves rows from a table. A row is a sequence of expressions defined after the `SELECT` keyword.
Expressions may have optional aliases.

`table_name` refers to a single `IMap` data structure. A table may have an optional alias.

An optional `WHERE` clause defines a `condition`, that is any expression that evaluates to a result of type boolean.
Any row that doesn't satisfy the condition is eliminated from the result.

== Sorting

You can use standard the SQL clauses `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` to sort and limit the result set.
Note that, for this, you need to add indexes to the map objects to be queried and sorted.
See the xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#indexing-queries[indexing section]
for information on adding and configuring indexes.

See the below examples for sorting.

The following statement gets the top five employees ordered by the
`first_name` field and skipping the first three ones:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
    employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY first_name
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3;
----

The following statement gets the top five employees with the highest salaries.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
    employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

== Unsupported Features

The following features are *not supported* and are planned for future releases:

* `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`
* `JOIN`
* set operators (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `MINUS`)
* subqueries (`SELECT ... FROM table WHERE x = (SELECT â€¦)`)
