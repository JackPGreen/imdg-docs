= CP Subsystem Listeners

The CP Subsystem provides the following listeners:

* CP membership listeners
* CP group availability listeners

The following sections explain each listener and
how to register them.

== CP Membership Listener

`CPMembershipListener` is notified when a CP member is added to or removed
from the CP Subsystem. Its signature is very similar to Hazelcast's usual
xref:events:cluster-events.adoc#listening-for-member-events[`MembershipListener`].

The listener interface has methods that are invoked for the following events:

* `memberAdded`: A new CP member is added to the CP subsystem.
* `memberRemoved`: An existing CP member is removed from the CP subsystem.

To get notified for CP membership events, you implement the `CPMembershipListener` interface.

The following is an example `CPMembershipListener` class:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/cp/event/CPMembershipListenerImpl.java[tag=impl]
----

=== Registering CP Membership Listeners

`CPMembershipListener` can be defined in the configuration or can be registered
in runtime via the `CPSubsystem` API.

Below is an example registering the listener in runtime using the `CPSubsystem.addMembershipListener` method:

[source,java]
----
// Either server or client
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = ...;
hazelcastInstance.getCPSubsystem().addMembershipListener(new CPMembershipListenerImpl());
----

The following is an example programmatic configuration:

[tabs] 
==== 
Server:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.addListenerConfig(new ListenerConfig("com.yourpackage.CPMembershipListenerImpl"));
----
--

Client::
+
[source,java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.addListenerConfig(new ListenerConfig("com.yourpackage.CPMembershipListenerImpl"));
----
====

The followings are examples of the equivalent declarative configurations:

[tabs] 
====

== CP Group Availability Listener

`CPGroupAvailabilityListener` is notified when the availability of a CP group decreases
or it loses the majority completely.

In general, the availability decreases when a CP member becomes unreachable because of process crash,
network partition, out of memory, etc. Once a member is declared as unavailable
by the Hazelcast's failure detector, that member is removed from the cluster.
If it is also a CP member, ``CPGroupAvailabilityEvent``s are fired for each CP group
that member belongs to.

As a special case, `CPGroupAvailabilityListener` has a separate method to report
the loss of majority. When the majority of a CP group is lost, that CP group cannot make
progress anymore. Even a new CP member cannot join to this CP group
since membership changes also go through the Raft consensus algorithm.

When a CP group has lost its majority:

* If the group is a non-METADATA CP group, it must be force-destroyed immediately,
because it can block the METADATA CP group to perform membership changes on the CP Subsystem.
* If the majority of the METADATA CP group permanently crashes, unfortunately
it is equivalent to the permanent crash of the majority CP members of the whole CP Subsystem,
even though other CP groups are running fine.

The listener interface has methods that are invoked for the following events:

* `availabilityDecreased`: A CP group's availability decreases,
but still has the majority of members available.
* `majorityLost`: A CP group has lost its majority.

The following is an example `CPGroupAvailabilityListener` class:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/cp/event/CPGroupAvailabilityListenerImpl.java[tag=impl]
----

=== Registering CP Group Availability Listeners

Similar to `CPMembershipListener`, a `CPGroupAvailabilityListener` can be defined
in the configuration or can be registered in runtime via the `CPSubsystem` API.

Below is an example registering the listener in runtime using the `CPSubsystem.addGroupAvailabilityListener` method:

[source,java]
----
// Either server or client
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = ...;
hazelcastInstance.getCPSubsystem().addGroupAvailabilityListener(new CPGroupAvailabilityListenerImpl());
----

The following is an example programmatic configuration:

[tabs] 
==== 
Server:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.addListenerConfig(new ListenerConfig("com.yourpackage.CPGroupAvailabilityListenerImpl"));
----
--

Client::
+
[source,java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.addListenerConfig(new ListenerConfig("com.yourpackage.CPGroupAvailabilityListenerImpl"));
----

The followings are examples of the equivalent declarative configurations:

[tabs]

        <listener>
